## General Information
- The US based company Surprise Housing is trying to expand their business in Australian market by understanding the sales price of sold houses with respect to different driving factors. Once such factors are identified, these will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables in the new market so that They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns by purchasing houses at a price below their actual values and quickly sell them on at a higher price. The analysis is done on historical data of House sales in the Australia market.

## Conclusions
- It has been observed that the six most important driving factors behind sales price are 'GrLivArea', 'OverallQual', 'LotArea', 'OverallCond', '1stFlrSF' and 'age'. Intuitively, sales price increases when the living area, overall quality grade (of material/finish), overall condition, Lot size, 1st floor area of house increase. On the other hand, if the age of the house is more i,e for old houses, the sales price gets decreased. However, the available data set has very less observations compared to number of features, we may find more patterns if more data is available at hand.
